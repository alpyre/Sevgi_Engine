Sevgi Engine is a new open source video game engine for classic Amiga computers that provides the required tools and generates the boilerplate code to create high-performing Amiga games using only the C programming language. It is built around the great [ScrollingTricks](https://aminet.net/package/dev/src/ScrollingTrick) by Georg Steger.

### Features
* **Performance**
  <br>All display algorithms aim to perform at a locked 50fps on a single buffered native Amiga chipset display. It implements an optimized version of the algorithm Scroller_XYUnlimited2_64 from [ScrollingTricks](https://aminet.net/package/dev/src/ScrollingTrick). Benefits highly from Fast Ram where available.</br>
* **System friendly**
  <br>Aims to work on all ROM versions (2.0+) providing a clean quit back to OS without needing WHDLoad.</br>
* **AGA Support**
  <br>Supports all features provided by the AGA chipset.</br>
* **No limitations**
  <br>Designed to support all the well known visual tricks known by the popular Amiga video game titles while not limiting more experimental effects to be implemented.</br>
* **UI**
  <br>Code to create customizable mouse driven GUI objects (buttons, input gadgets, checkboxes etc.) with auto-layout and modern features, which can also be accessed by the keyboard or the joysticks. ***NEW FEATURE***</br>
* **Easy development**
  <br>A native editor program is provided to generate code, manage game assets, edit color palettes etc. called **Sevgi Editor**. Other elements like game logic, animation and events require programming knowledge in C. The programming and compiling can be made natively (on the Amiga OS - using native compilers) or cross platfrom (on Windows or Linux PCs - using cross development tools). Sevgi Editor can import game maps made in [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/).</br>
* **Templates**
  <br>Generates ready to compile and run game code from template genres which aims to ease bootstrapping. The templates include test assets.</br>
* **ptplayer**
  <br>Implements the great [ptplayer](https://aminet.net/package/mus/play/ptplayer) by Frank Wille for music and audio effects.</br>
* **No third party dependencies**
  <br>The game executable will not require any libraries[^1]</br>
* **Documentation**
  <br>The engine code is very well commented and documented in detail in Amigaguide format.</br>

[^1]:Except diskfont.library. And even that is avoidable if you do not use any Amiga font asset.

### Sevgi Editor
Sevgi Engine code and template assets are generated using the provided editor called Sevgi Editor.

### Requirements
* ECS or AGA Amiga
* Kickstart 2.0+
* MUI 3.8 (for Sevgi Editor)

### Build
This source code which creates Sevgi Editor (which then can generate the engine code) is developed to be compiled with gcc (using any of [adtools](https://github.com/jens-maus/amigaos-cross-toolchain) or [bebbo's](https://github.com/bebbo/amiga-gcc) cross toolchains[^2]).
To compile for 68k[^3] target:

`make`

Compiled binaries can also be acquired from [aminet](https://aminet.net/package/dev/c/Sevgi_Engine).

Sevgi Engine code is suitable to be compiled with any Amiga compiler. Makefiles for SAS/C and gcc are provided and these compilers are tested to work. It includes and uses SDI_headers, so (hopefully) it is compiler agnostic.

[^2]:These toolchains should be built using MUI and CGX prefixes of course.
[^3]:Since this source includes and utilizes SDI_headers, it can be compiled also for MorphOS and AmigaOS4 targets, yet these two are not tested to work.

### Templates
Sevgi Editor comes with some ready to compile and run game templates from different genres which demonstrates its features using some free assets.

### Licences
Sevgi Engine and Sevgi Editor is under [MIT Licence](https://opensource.org/license/mit). Meaning you can use it in whatever project you want as long as you include the original copyright and license notice.
ptplayer is public domain under [The Unlicence](https://opensource.org/license/unlicense) licence.

### Future Plans
Sevgi Engine is still a work in progress. Some new features planned are:
* Support for different level display implementations (i.e double buffering, split screen etc.)
* More graphical effects
* A native tilemap and gameobject editor
* More templates for different game genres
